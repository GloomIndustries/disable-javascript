          <h2>What's new (2.2.0)</h2>
          <p>
            There was a bug on Firefox Quantum which didn't update web extension icons after installation.
            As a workaround for this, this web extension used to force refresh all active tabs on installation/update.
            After some feedback on GitHub and in form of reviews, I'm glad to tell you that this behavior was removed since the Firefox bug was fixed in the meantime.<br />

            In addition to this, the about page now also only pops up when there was a major or minor web extension update.<br />
            Browser updates or patch updates of the web extension won't open the about page any longer!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can now add base domains that automatically disable JS for any sub domains when adding a new domain via the
            <a href="options.html">settings page</a>.<br />
            Be careful when using this feature though, as <a href="https://github.com/dpacassi/disable-javascript/issues/18">complete inheritance</a> is not supported yet.
